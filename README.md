This package allows an easy way to expose the Laravel Horizon Metrics to Prometheus.

## Prom... What?

Prometheus is a scraping service which allows you to easily store and scrape information from your application, server or even from your router!
Prometheus itself does not know about your application, so you need a exporter on your app. This small package is exactly this, an exporter which allows Prometheus to understand some information
from your application. With Prometheus and a visualisation tool called `Grafana` you can build something like this beautiful Dashboard:

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require lkaemmerling/laravel-horizon-prometheus-exporter
```

## Configuration
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=LKDevelopment\\HorizonPrometheusExporter\\HorizonPrometheusExporterServiceProvider
```
You can configure this package by changing the values in `config/horizon-exporter.php`.

## Custom Metrics

You can also use this package easily to expose custom metrics. You just need to implement the `LKDevelopment\HorizonPrometheusExporter\Contracts\Exporter` interface and then add your implementation to your `config/horizon-exporter.php` like we do it for the Horizon exporters: https://github.com/LKaemmerling/laravel-horizon-prometheus-exporter/blob/master/config/config.php#L17

## Dashboard

You can find a sample dashboard using this metrics on the [Grafana Marketplace](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11034).

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
